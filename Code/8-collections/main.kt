//Simple Lists, Sets and Maps are immutable,
//which means that you canâ€™t add or remove items after the collection has been initialized.
//If you want to be able to add or remove items,
//Kotlin has mutable subtypes that you can use instead: MutableList, MutableSet and MutableMap.
//So if you want all the benefits of using a List and you want to be able to update its contents, use a MutableList.
